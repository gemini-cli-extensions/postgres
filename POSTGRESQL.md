## PostgreSQL MCP Server (Data Plane: Connecting and Querying)

This section covers connecting to a PostgreSQL database instance.

1.  **Verify Environment Variables**: The extension requires the following environment variables to be set before the Gemini CLI is started:

    *   `POSTGRES_HOST`: The hostname or IP address of the PostgreSQL server.
    *   `POSTGRES_PORT`: The port number of the PostgreSQL server.
    *   `POSTGRES_DATABASE`: The name of the database to connect to.
    *   `POSTGRES_USER`: The username for authentication.
    *   `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: The password for authentication.

2.  **Handle Missing Variables**: If a command fails with an error message containing a placeholder like `${POSTGRES_HOST}`, it signifies a missing environment variable. Inform the user which variable is missing and instruct them to set it.

3.  **Handle Permission Errors**: If an operation fails due to permission, it is
    likely that the user do not have the correct privileges on the PostgreSQL
    database. Database-level permissions (e.g., `SELECT`, `INSERT`) are required
    to execute queries.
